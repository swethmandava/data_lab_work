Input: I, instance set of current node
Input: d, feature dimension

For each node
	G = sum(gi) , H = sum(hi)
	For i = 1 to num_features do
		GL = 0, HL = 0
		For j in sorted(I by features i) do
			GL = GL + gj 
			HL = HL + hj
			GR = G - GL
			HR = H - HL
			score_j = compute_score(GL, HL, GR, HR, G, H)
			score = max(score, score_j)
		End
	End
	Further Split node on max Score
